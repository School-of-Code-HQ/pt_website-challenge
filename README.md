# Group Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first pair project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about someone in your group using HTML and CSS.

For example, if you are in group A, pair 1, you will be making a website for someone in group A, pair 2.

The the person you are making your website for is your client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what they want from a profile site, and then build it for them. You should also think about who will be using the site: the other bootcampers on the course.

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core programming languages of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website to someone elses requirements - a key learning abjective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with your group to find out everything you need in order to design and build their website.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, we still expect you to pair program with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the project, and you will be given time in the live evening sessions to work on it as well.
